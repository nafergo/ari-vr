<div item=1.3.0><h1>Four Novels</h1><p>Early in her writing career, Ayn Rand’s publishers assumed the responsibility for designing book covers, examples of which are displayed here. However, by the 1970s, Rand’s reputation was well established; and she was able to participate in the art direction of a series of new covers for her fiction and nonfiction works. These later covers, incorporating original paintings into fields of white, were executed by painter, Robert Heindel, an contemporary artist whose depictions of ballet dancers, athletes and scientists, aligned with Rand’s view of the ideal human figure. </p></div>

<div item=2.1><h1>Soviet Russia</h1><h2>Early Writings</h2><p>After completing her studies at the University of Leningrad in 1924, Ayn Rand enrolled at the State Technicum for Screen Arts, a film school established by Lenin for the development of Soviet cinema. Her objective was to study screenwriting, and in preparation she also began writing film reviews and short essays on Hollywood, some of which were published. She briefly thought about becoming a Soviet screenwriter, subtly incorporating her individualist ethical and political ideas into her scripts. But this early experiment with literary misdirection failed. The collectivist nature of Russian politics and culture was monolithic.  And she realized her prospects for survival in Soviet Russia were nonexistent: “I would have been probably dead within one year,” she later concluded.</p></div>
