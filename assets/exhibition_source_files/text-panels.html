<div item=1.3><h1>A Writer’s Studio</h1><p>Ayn Rand (1905 - 82) was a 20th century Russian-American novelist who published four novels that have developed a worldwide audience. As a novelist-philosopher, her Romantic Realist works and original philosophical system, Objectivism, are known and discussed. And today there is increasing interest in the physical circumstances in which she produced these works: her “writer studio.”</p><p>Ayn Rand wrote her four novels, as well as other fiction and nonfiction on a desk purchased for her in Los Angeles in 1929 by her husband, Frank O’Connor. The desk occupied more than a dozen apartments and a house in two cities, Los Angeles and New York, between 1929 and 1982. On this desk she wrote her four novels plus other fiction and nonfiction works.</p><p>As a literary artist, Ayn Rand considered herself a Romantic Realist. She believed that art should depict what is metaphysically important in life. In her paraphrase of Aristotle's Poetics, art is concerned not with human history reported journalistically, but human life recreated and portrayed as it could be and ought to be. This was Ayn Rand’s artisti credo.</p><p>A Writer’s Studio examines Rand’s literary art from the perspective of the physical circumstances of her life while she was creating it. The exhibit incorporates artifacts from the Ayn Rand Archives, including ones selected from her personal papers and effects. The focus is Ayn Rand’s four published novels. The objects on display concretize her youthful decision to leave Soviet Russia and to establish herself in America--and to achieve “what ought to be” both in her art and in her life.</p></div>
 
<div item=1.3.2><h1>Four Novels</h1><p>Early in her writing career, Ayn Rand’s publishers assumed the responsibility for designing book covers, examples of which are displayed here. However, by the 1970s, Rand’s reputation was well established; and she was able to participate in the art direction of a series of new covers for her fiction and nonfiction works. These later covers, incorporating original paintings into fields of white, were executed by painter, Robert Heindel, an contemporary artist whose depictions of ballet dancers, athletes and scientists, aligned with Rand’s view of the ideal human figure. </p></div>

<div item=2.1><h1>Soviet Russia</h1><h2>Early Writings</h2><p>After completing her studies at the University of Leningrad in 1924, Ayn Rand enrolled at the State Technicum for Screen Arts, a film school established by Lenin for the development of Soviet cinema. Her objective was to study screenwriting, and in preparation she also began writing film reviews and short essays on Hollywood, some of which were published. She briefly thought about becoming a Soviet screenwriter, subtly incorporating her individualist ethical and political ideas into her scripts. But this early experiment with literary misdirection failed. The collectivist nature of Russian politics and culture was monolithic.  And she realized her prospects for survival in Soviet Russia were nonexistent: “I would have been probably dead within one year,” she later concluded.</p></div>

<div item=2.8><h1>Leaving Soviet Russia</h1><p>During the Soviet period, Ayn Rand’s mother received a letter from a cousin living in Chicago who worked as a film exhibitor. A visit to America was proposed, which coincided with the easing of Soviet restrictions on students wishing to study abroad. The official purpose of Rand’s visit would be to study the American film industry first-hand and then to return and contribute the fruits of this research toward the development of Soviet film. The stated purpose was a ruse. Rand planned to make her American visit permanent. Her goal was to establish herself as a screenwriter, thereafter “graduating into literature” when her command of English had improved.</p></div>

<div item=4.1.2><h1>New York Interlude</h1><p>Ayn Rand’s first novel, We the Living, was completed in 1934 but was rejected by numerous publishers, until The Macmillan Company in the United States and Cassells and Company in England published the book in 1936. The most autobiographical of her novels, it was based on her years under Soviet tyranny. Its theme was the evil of dictatorship.</p><p>In 1934, Ayn Rand and her husband moved from Hollywood to New York City in order to work on a Broadway production of Night of January 16th. She began writing The Fountainhead in 1935. In the character of the architect Howard Roark, she presented for the first time the kind of hero whose depiction was the chief goal of her writing: the ideal man, man as "he could be and ought to be."</p><p>In 1937, Ayn Rand took a break from The Fountainhead in order to write a new work originally entitled, “Ego,” and later renamed, Anthem.</p><p>The Fountainhead was rejected by twelve publishers but finally accepted by the Bobbs-Merrill Company. When published in 1943, it made history by becoming a best seller through word-of-mouth two years later, and gained for its author lasting recognition as a champion of individualism.</p></div>

<div item=5.1.2><h1>Von Sternberg House</h1><p>Ayn Rand returned to Hollywood in late 1943 to write the screenplay for the Warner Bros. film production of The Fountainhead, but wartime restrictions delayed production until 1948.

<div item=6.1.2><h1>6.1.2</h1><p>Ayn Rand described the theme of Atlas Shrugged as “the role of the mind in man’s existence — and, as a corollary, the demonstration of a new moral philosophy: the morality of rational self-interest.”</p><p>The idea for the novel occurred to her in 1943, while discussing the philosophy of The Fountainhead with an acquaintance who insisted that Rand was obligated to enlighten her readers with a nonfiction version of her ethical philosophy. Rand countered she had already fulfilled the obligation and that her case was clear to any attentive reader of her fiction. However, she wondered aloud, “What would happen if every creative person went on strike against such obligations?” That, she exclaimed, would make a good novel. After the discussion ended, [her husband Frank] O’Connor, who was in the room at the time, turned to her and said: “It would make a good novel.”</p><p>The story of Atlas Shrugged concerns men and women of ability in all fields, who are oppressed by a collectivist world that refuses to recognize their value. The background is modern industrial civilization. When the story opens, New York City is crumbling . . . . living conditions are getting worse. The world’s generator is running low, but no one knows why. Against this backdrop, Rand would present and dramatize her entire philosophy.</p></div>

Rand thought that it would be both dramatic and ironic to present a strike by industrialists — the “prime movers” — against a moral code that branded them as evil exploiters. Eventually, Rand dropped the original title, “The Strike,” as too journalistic sounding.</p><p><i>Any Rand Archives</i></p></div>

The expression “Who is John Galt?” — which occurs throughout the novel — evokes the despair and futility of a world in decline.</p><p>Rand wrote her fiction in longhand. After a typist created a typescript of each sequence, Rand further revisions by hand. Of the more than 12,000 pages contained in the final handwritten manuscript, she estimated that each page was rewritten, on average, five times.</p><p><i>Any Rand Archives</i></p></div>

Rand’s interest in philosophy arose primarily out of her interest in portraying the ideal man in fiction. She wanted to define the philosophical premises that would make such a character possible. Atlas Shrugged and its theme of “the mind on strike” would provide Rand further motivation to develop her philosophy. The novel would combine abstract statement, concretizing drama and the portrayal of new heroic characters.</p><p><i>Any Rand Archives</i></p></div>

Hank Rearden, an industrialist struggling under the world’s moral code, listens to Francisco d’Anconia, a former copper magnate. The decision to “shrug,” and thereby let the world fall, requires a moral sanction — a sanction permitted by a radical, new code of morality. Rearden’s discovery of this new morality is dramatized in the remainder of the novel.</p><p><i>Any Rand Archives</i></p></div>

The outline here covers four branches of philosophy: Metaphysics (the nature of reality); Epistemology (the nature of knowledge and its validation); Ethics (the good); Politics (the nature of a proper social system). She also lists economics, which is not a branch of philosophy. In her speech Galt explains the moral foundations of a capitalist economic system.</p><p>Rand’s defense of the prime movers required that she formulate her own views on numerous philosophical issues, including the origin of values, the nature of volition, the law of identity as the bridge between metaphysics and epistemology, the finitude of space and time, and the nature of universals. When a philosophical issue arose during the writing of the novel, she would think about it for several days and then, in one or two attempts, resolve the problem.</p><p><i>Any Rand Archives</i></p></div>
